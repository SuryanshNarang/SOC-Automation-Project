# SOC Automation with Wazuh, The Hive, and Shuffle

![Project Workflow Diagram](https://github.com/SuryanshNarang/SOC-Automation-Project/blob/main/SOCAutomation.jpg) <!-- Replace with the actual path to your diagram -->

## üìã Introduction

This project implements a **Security Operations Center (SOC) Automation** system utilizing **Wazuh**, **The Hive**, and **Shuffle**. The objective is to automate threat detection, enrichment, and incident response to enhance security monitoring and incident management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Overview

The system is composed of three main components:

1. **Wazuh** ‚Äì Detects security threats and generates alerts.
2. **Shuffle** ‚Äì Automates alert enrichment with OSINT and forwards enriched alerts.
3. **The Hive** ‚Äì Manages incidents, allowing SOC analysts to investigate and respond.

### High-Level Workflow:

1. **Wazuh Agent** (Windows 10) monitors systems for suspicious activity.
2. Alerts are enriched via **Shuffle** with OSINT information.
3. Enriched alerts are sent to **The Hive** for incident management.
4. SOC analysts investigate the incidents and initiate response actions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Project Components and Roles

### 1. Wazuh (SIEM)
- **Role**: Detects security threats and generates alerts.
- **Components**:
  - **Wazuh Agent (Windows 10)**: Deployed on a Windows 10 virtual machine to monitor system logs and activities.
  - **Wazuh Server**: Processes the data received from the Wazuh agent and generates security alerts based on predefined rules.
  - **Wazuh Dashboard**: Provides a visual interface for monitoring security events and alerts.

### Diagram:
Here's a detailed look at the Wazuh workflow: from agent modules to security alerts via the Elastic Stack.

### 2. The Hive (Incident Response Platform)
- **Role**: Manages and tracks security incidents generated from Wazuh alerts. Alerts from Wazuh are ingested into The Hive and transformed into incidents for further investigation.
- **Functionality**: Analysts can view, investigate, and respond to incidents through The Hive‚Äôs user-friendly interface.

### 3. Shuffle (Automation Orchestrator)
- **Role**: Automates the enrichment of Wazuh alerts and forwards them to The Hive for incident management.
- **Functionality**: Shuffle integrates with third-party OSINT services to enhance alerts with additional context before sending them to The Hive.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The architecture consists of:

- **Windows 10 VM**: Acts as the **Wazuh Agent**, collecting data and sending it to the Wazuh server.
- **Ubuntu VM**: Hosts **Wazuh Server**, **The Hive**, and **Shuffle**, processing the agent data and managing incidents.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu VM with **Wazuh**, **The Hive**, and **Shuffle** installed.
- Windows 10 VM acting as the **Wazuh Agent**.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Wazuh**:
   - Set up Wazuh on the Ubuntu VM as the server and install the agent on the Windows 10 VM.

2. **Install The Hive**:
   - Configure The Hive on the same Ubuntu VM to manage incidents generated by Wazuh.

3. **Install Shuffle**:
   - Set up Shuffle to automate alert enrichment and forward enriched data to The Hive.

### Configuration
- Configure Wazuh to monitor the Windows 10 VM and detect suspicious activities.
- Shuffle is set up to enrich alerts with OSINT before sending them to The Hive.
- The Hive is configured to ingest enriched alerts and manage incidents accordingly.

## üìù Conclusion

This project demonstrates the synergy of **Wazuh** for threat detection, **The Hive** for incident management, and **Shuffle** for automation and enrichment. The combined efforts result in a streamlined SOC workflow that significantly reduces response times and enhances overall security posture.
